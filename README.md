## This zip file contains source code and datasets for our ICCV19 paper “AttPool : Towards Hierarchical Feature Representation in Graph Convolutional Networks via Attention Mechanism”

## To run our code, please follow the steps below:

### Dependencies:

Pytorch >=1.0.0, Python >=3.5

### Usage:

* run `pip3 install -r requirement.txt`

* We provide all datasets that have been mentioned in the paper for testing. 

* We provide shell scripts, for training baseline , AttPool-G and AttPool-L models with 10- fold cross validation on datasets, respectively. For example, to train AttPool-G on the NCI1 dataset, please  run the shell script `./run_attpool_global_nci1.sh`.
* You can find the shell scripts for different datasets in the direcotry ./script
